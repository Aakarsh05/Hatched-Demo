Webinar turned overall turned out to be very nice
git is diffrent from OOP languages we learn at our schools, was totally a diffrent experience. 
Introduction to github and learning to make pull requests and participating in Hacktober fest was the best part,
The theory explanation was also done very well and kept the intrest to listen and learn in me.
The most boring part of the webinar was perhaps to be honest the introduction to hatch.ed, I feel it could have been done in a better way. 
The breaking of voices and connection issues probably made it more boring than it was supposed to be, 
The hatch.ed startup seemed to be an amazing and innovative startup for it would help students who code for passion or for getting a good board percentage, the details
could have been explained in a better way to attract the intrest.
As for me 'Aatankwadi' failed to detoriate the enthusiasm any participant in the webinar as it met my expectations in the end.
I would give a rating of 7.5/10 for the webinar and would attend if you guys do something like this in the future.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {

   cout << "Thank you for such an amazing session!";
 
   return 0;
}
