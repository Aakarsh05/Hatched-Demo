HELLO! I AM JYOTSANA SINGH, STUDYING CSE AT KIIT, BHUBANESHWAR. I ALWAYS HAD THE INTEREST IN CODING BUT COULD NOT GIVE MUCH TIME TO IT DUE TO SCHOOL AND COACHING. I GOT TO KNOW 
ABOUT HATCH.ED FROM A SENIOR OF MINE AND I FOUND IT QUITE INTERESTING. THE WEBINAR CONDUCTED WAS QUITE STUDENT FRINEDLY AND WAS IN LAY MAN'S LANGUAGE MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN. I COULD EASILY PARTICIPATE IN HACKTOBERFEST. THANK YOU FOR THE WEBINAR. I WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN MANY MORE EVENTS TO COME 
UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF HATCH.ED. THANK YOU.
